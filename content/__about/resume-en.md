It aims to be a role of 'stairs' for underground wrappers in Korea.
I have been using JavaScript for some time now, and I am migrating to a newer version, assuming the code is immature in terms of scalability and structure.

## soso-tip

- GitHub Repository Link: https://github.com/SoYoung210/soso-tip

It is not a development project. I have collected some of the issues I have encountered during the development process.
I think it is possible to reduce the same mistakes by repeating the process of collecting and sharing experiences.
